Experiments in which socially deprived juvenile male mammals develop into sexually incompetent adults, along with widespread sexual dimorphism in rough-and-tumble play (R and T), suggest that R and T may prepare juvenile males for adult sexual behaviour. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a longitudinal study of American mink (Neovison vison) on two farms, w
ith two cohorts each. For males (n = 121), we predicted that individuals with the highest frequencies of rough-and-tumble play as juveniles (10-20 weeks old) would, as adults, show shorter latencies to bite females' necks and to begin copulating, and copulate for longer durations. On one farm, we conducted a pilot study of females (n = 10) as a preliminary test of the hypothesis that R and T also prepares females for adult sexual behaviour. Here, our predictions were the opposite of those for males, since abilities to limit the number or duration of copulations could allow females to exercise pre- or post-copulatory mate choice. In total, we observed 1669 male-female encounters, and 1004 separate copulations. As predicted, frequent juvenile R and T predicted long-lasting copulations in adult males, and also longer latencies to copulate in adult females. This was true specifically of rough-and-tumble play itself, independently of general activity levels and, among a subset of 32 males reared in environmentally enriched housing, also independently of solitary object play. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that juvenile rough-and-tumble play predicts adult sexual behaviour in any species. Further research is required to test whether our female results can be replicated, and, importantly, to determine whether play truly has a causal role in either of these correlational relationships.","2011-07 to  2014-03","Department of Animal Biosciences.

Intestinal dysbiosis and inflammation are common traits of these disorders. FP is, therefore, proposed to be a behavioral consequence of dysregulated communication between the gut and the brain. Probiotic supplementation represents a promising new therapeutic to mitigate widespread FP. We monitored FP, gut microbiota composition, immune markers and amino acids related to the production of neurochemicals with Lactobacillus rhamnosus supplement (Lacto) or a placebo in laying hens. Data demonstrate that, when stressed, the incidence of FP increased significantly, however, Lacto prevented this increase. Lacto showed strong immunological effects by increasing the regulatory T cell population of the spleen and the cecal tonsils, in addition to limiting cecal microbiota dysbiosis. Despite minimal changes of aromatic amino acid levels, data suggest that catecholaminergic circuits may be an interesting target for further studies. Overall, our findings provide the first data supporting the use of a single-strain probiotic to reduce stress-induced FP in chickens and has promise to improve the welfare of domestic birds.","2017-10 to  2017-12","Department of Animal Biosciences.

Michelle; Torrey, Stephanie","Agricultural Sciences","broiler chicken; welfare; inactivity; behaviour; slower-growing","Experimental data","Selection for rapid growth has produced heavier, more efficient broiler chickens, but has also introduced health and welfare issues, which may cause or be caused by inactivity. Rapid growth may also limit the performance of motivated behaviors, whereas the provision of enrichment may increase these behaviors and general activity. This study aimed to evaluate the inactivity, behavior patterns, and enrichment use of 2 fast- (CONV) and 12 slower-growing broiler strains (categorized as fastest [FAST], moderate [MOD], and slowest slow [SLOW]), based on their growth rates; 4 strains/category]. To evaluate inactivity, one male and one female from 153 pens were outfitted with omnidirectional accelerometers from d 21 until processing (14 −24 birds/strain from 8 to 12 pens/strain). Additionally, to supplement inactivity data, 5-min continuous behavioral observations of four focal birds per pen (2 males, 2 females) were conducted on days 26, 42, and 56 (72−148 observations of 8−12 pens/strain) to quantify the duration and frequency of various behaviors; at the same time, 5 to 11 instantaneous scan samples were also performed for pen-based enrichment use. Inactivity peaked at 78 to 80% of the day for all strains; however, those with slower growth rates reached these levels at older ages. Compared to slower growing strains at the same age, faster growing strains were more inactive, spent more time sitting and feeding, spent less time standing and walking, and used enrichments less; these differences mostly occurred at younger ages. Generally, at the same age, strains with similar growth rates (within the same category) behaved similarly, with only a few exceptions. Results suggest that not all strains identified as “slow-growing” broilers behave differently from fast-growing broilers, nor do they all behave similarly to each other. As such, results suggest that improved broiler welfare, particularly with respect to reduced inactivity, the performance of a wider range of normal, motivated behaviors, and/or increased enrichment use, is related to the broiler strain’s specific growth rate."," to  ","Department of Animal Biosciences.

Michelle; Torrey, Stephanie","Agricultural Sciences","meat yield; myopathies; processing traits; slow-growth; chicken meat","Experimental data","Selection for accelerated growth rate and high breast yield in broiler chickens have been associated with an increase in myopathies, including wooden breast (WB) and white striping (WS). To investigate effects of growth rate on carcass traits and incidence of myopathies, 14 strains were evaluated, encompassing 2 conventional(CONV; strains B and C: ADG0-48 > 60 g/d)and 12 slower-growing (SL) strains. The latter were categorized based on growth rate: FAST (strains F, G, I and M; ADG0-62=53−55 g/d), MOD (strains E, H, O and S; ADG0-62=50-51 g/d), and SLOW (strains D, J, K and N; ADG0-62<50 g/d). In a randomized incomplete block design, 7,216 mixed-sex birds were equally allocated into 164 pens (44 birds/pen; 30 kg/m2), with each strain represented in 8 to 12 pens over 2 to 3 production cycles. From each pen, 4 males and 4 females were processed at 2 Target Weights (TWs) based on their expected time to reach 2.1 kg BW (TW 1: 34 d for CONV; 48 d for SL strains) and 3.2 kg BW (TW 2: 48 d for CONV; 62 d for SL strains). Weights and yields for the carcass, breast, drumsticks, thighs, and wings were obtained; breast fillets were assessed to determine the presence and severity of WB and WS. At both TWs, breast yield was higher as growth rate increased (P < 0.001), with CONV having greater breast yield than other categories. Strain F had the greatest breast yield at both TWs (P < 0.001) within the FAST category. At TW 2, CONV had the greatest incidence of WB and WS (P < 0.001). However, within FAST, strain F had the greatest incidence of myopathies (P < 0.001) at both TWs, exhibiting values as high or as greater than CONV birds. The incidence of WB and WS in strains with differing growth rates but high breast meat yield suggests that the latter may play a major role in the occurrence of these myopathies."," to  ","Department of Animal Biosciences.

There was interaction (P = 0.022) between BSDFM and Eimeria on d 10 to 35 FCR such that the FCR of challenged -BSDFM birds was poor than that of unchallenged counterparts, but none differed with +BSDFM birds. There was an interaction (P = 0.039) between BSDFM and Eimeria on d 14 bursa weight with challenged birds exhibiting heavier bursa than unchallenged +BSDFM birds. Eimeria reduced (P = 0.01) and BSDFM (P = 0.002) increased the villi height to crypt depth ratio.

However, issues around cost, sustainability, and product acceptance have necessitated the search for alternatives to feeding hens fish oil for DHA enrichment. The effects of feeding 2 algal oils on egg production and DHA enrichment in eggs and selected tissues were investigated. The algal oils were: 1) OmegaPro (OPAO) standardized algal oil for DHA content and 2) Crude algal oil (CAO). A total of 400, 46-wk-old Lohmann LSL lite hens were housed in enriched cages (10 birds/cage) and allocated 5 diets (n = 8) for a 12-wk trial. The iso-caloric and -nitrogenous diets were a standard corn and soybean meal diet, standard plus 0.25 or 0.76% OPAO and standard plus 0.23 or 0.69% CAO; algal oils diets supplied similar DHA at each level. Egg production indices (hen day egg production, feed intake, FCR, egg weight, egg mass, and eggshell quality) were monitored for 10 wk. Diet samples were analyzed for fatty acids (FA) on wk 1, 6, and 12 and eggs on wk 4, 5, 6, 9, and 12. At the end of the trial, one hen/cage was weighed and dissected for liver, breast and thigh for FA and long bones for ash content analyses. Concentration of omega-6 to omega-3 FA ratio was 12.9, 6.64, 3.48, 6.96, and 3.59 for standard, 0.23 and 0.76% OPAO, 0.25 and 0.69% CAO, respectively. Algal oils increased (P ≤ 0.046) eggshell thickness linearly. The concentration of DHA in the eggs from the birds fed the standard, 0.23 and 0.76% OPAO, 0.25 and 0.69% CAO was 84, 195, 286, 183, and 297 mg/100g egg, respectively, and algal oils enriched eggs with DHA linearly and quadratically (P ≤ 0.01). In conclusion, algal oils increased the concentration of DHA in eggs and had no adverse effects on egg production and eggshell quality.","2022-04-11 to  2022-08-15","Department of Animal Bioscience.

A total of 524-day-old Ross 708 pullets were placed in floor pens (∼24 birds/pen) for the starter (0–4 WOA) and grower (5–18 WOA) phases, then transferred to the egg production facility and redistributed to ∼20 birds/pen for the prelay phase (19–22 WOA). Two diets were allocated to pens (0–18 WOA; n = 11) and (19–22 WOA; n-12). The diets were a control corn and soybean meal diet formulated to meet specifications and control plus 0.05% HY (HY). Birds had ad libitum access to feed in the first week and daily feed allocation based on pen BW from 2 WOA. Birds had free access to water throughout the trial. Body weight (BW) and uniformity (BW CV) were monitored. Boosters for infectious bronchitis and New Castle disease vaccines were administered at 18 WOA, and samples of pullets bled for antibody titer 5-day later. One pullet/pen was randomly selected, weighed, bled for plasma biochemistry, and necropsied for organ weights, ceca digesta for short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), and leg bones morphometry. In the starter and grower phases, birds fed HY were lighter and gained less (P < 0.05) than control birds. However, there were no diet effects (P > 0.05) on growth, the BW prelay phase, or BW uniformity throughout the trial. There were no (P > 0.05) diet effects on breast, gastrointestinal, liver and bursa weights, serum antibody titers, plasma biochemistry, SCFA and bone attributes. However, pullets fed HY had heavier (P = 0.047) spleen and tended to have lower (P = 0.080) plasma concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) relative to control pullets. In conclusion, the parameters assessed showed no negative consequences of feeding HY to broiler breeder pullets. However, effects on the spleen and plasma AST may indicate modest modulation of immunity and metabolism. The impact of the provision of HY during broiler breeder pullet phase on reproductive performance and chick quality should be investigated.","2022-09-06 to  2023-02-07","Department of Animal Biosciences.

Egg yolk color, albumen height, Haugh unit, eggshell thickness, and eggshell breaking strength were assessed every 4 wk. Individual hen body weight (BW) was recorded at 5-wk intervals to determine BW uniformity. At 52 and 63 WOA, the eggs and excreta samples were collected. At the end of the trial, 4 hens per pen were bled for plasma concentration of trace minerals and organs (liver, gizzard, spleen, kidney, and thymus) weight. There were no interactions between source and age on any parameters (P > 0.05). There were no main effects of source on egg production, eggshell quality, BW, and organs weight (P > 0.05). Hens fed HO diets had darker yolk compared to those fed OR diets (P = 0.014). The concentration of Zn in the eggs of OR BB was higher (P = 0.022) than for HO birds.

This study compared PQ in BSFLM with soybean meal (SBM) and fishmeal (FM) using the classical protein efficiency ratio (PER) chick growth assay model. A total of 240-male day-old Ross × Ross broiler chicks were allocated to 6 test diets for 10 d test. The corn starch-dextrose based diets were: 5 test diets containing 10% crude protein (CP) from casein (as a standard assay diet), SBM, FM, or BSFLM without or with (BSFLM+) additional essential amino acids (EAA) to match the levels of the SBM diet on digestible basis. A sixth diet was nitrogen-free (NFD), to enable calculation of net protein ratio (NPR). The birds had ad libitum access to feed and water, body weight (BW) and feed intake (FI) were recorded at the beginning and end of the experimental feeding period. Body weight gain (BWG), gain to feed ratio (G:F), crude protein intake (CPI), PER, and NPR were calculated. The analyzed CP (as fed) was 10.1, 12.8, 9.5, 11.7, and 14.9% for casein, SBM, FM, BSFLM, and BSFLM+ diets, respectively. Birds fed BSFLM+ had greater BWG (P < 0.01) than birds fed other diets.

The pandemic had seen an increase in home baking with people desiring to bake their own bread and cakes. Sourdough is considered to be healthier and tastier than conventional bread due to long fermentation times. This bread must be made from scratch, requiring time and resources. A company has developed a ready-to-use dry multigrain sourdough bread mix using local ingredients that takes less time to prepare while still allowing consumers to have a home baking experience. A sugar-free cake mix was also formulated which could be used to make cakes, muffins, and cup cakes. This healthy high-fibre mix is a basic mix which has endless possibilities of making variations as per customers choice such as adding raspberry, blueberry, or chocolate. Market validation is needed to better understand the potential market demand and consumer requirements for the product attributes of these two products (e.g., flavor, texture, ingredient, price etc.). For the test, the mixes were home delivered to the interested participants. They had to bake the products, taste them and complete an online survey.

The objective of the first survey was to evaluate the efficacy of various preplant herbicides for the control of glyphosate-resistant giant ragweed under field conditions in Ontario. A total of 11 field experiments were established on Ontario farms with glyphosate-resistant giant ragweed over a two-year period (2010 and 2011). One set of experiments evaluated herbicides with limited residual activity (enhanced burndown), and a second set of experiments evaluated glyphosate tank mixes with residual herbicides for full season control (burndown plus residual). In 2010, there was one enhanced burndown and one burndown plus residual trial at a location near Windsor (L1). In 2011, there were four enhanced burndown and five burndown plus residual trials at locations near Windsor (L2 and L3), Belle River (L4), LaSalle (L5) and Amherstburg (L6).   The objective of the postemergence survey was to determine the level of resistance to glyphosate in different giant ragweed populations, and evaluate the efficacy of various postemergence herbicides for the control of glyphosate-resistant giant ragweed in soybean under field conditions in Ontario. A total of ten field experiments were established on Ontario farms with glyphosate-resistant giant ragweed in 2011. One set of experiments evaluated the response of giant ragweed to varying doses of glyphosate (field dose response), and another set evaluated various herbicides registered for postemergence application in soybean. The experiments were conducted at locations near Windsor (L1 and L2), Belle River (L3), LaSalle (L4) and Amherstburg (L5).","2010 to  2011","Department of Plant Agriculture.

<p><b>Genetic diversity</b>: Genetic diversity was calculated in VCFtools software using the SNP data set (see accompanying repository file) to determine nucleotide diversity (π values) and genetic differentiation (F<sub>ST</sub> values). The π statistic provides an indication of polymorphism within a population as measured by nucleotide diversity, and Tajima’s D (D) provides an indication of selection pressure. Both π and D were measured in sliding windows of 1 Mb across the genome using the --window-pi and --TajimaD options in VCFtools, which resulted in an average of 6 SNPs per window. The pairwise π and D values were also calculated among different subpopulations. Genome-wide averages of π and D for each breeding history category were generated by taking the average across all windowed calculations. Landrace and PPB π values were compared across the genome, and regions where landrace π exceeded PPB π by more than 3× were considered highly differentiated, and the regions that were at least 25,000 bp in length were considered significant. To investigate the level of differentiation between the landrace and PPB genotypes the F<sub>ST</sub> statistic was computed. F<sub>ST</sub> was calculated using the --weir-fst-pop option in VCFtools in sliding windows of 100 bp across the genome. Weighted F<sub>ST</sub> values range from 0 with no genetic differentiation, to 1 where fixation of alleles has occurred. F<sub>ST</sub> values exceeding 0.5 were considered significant in our analysis.</p>

The main objective of this research was to investigate the effects of low R/FR light on nitrogen assimilation in corn. To explore this, changes to the nitrogen assimilation pathway were measured in corn seedlings nine days post-emergence under low R/FR and control light conditions. The observed results indicate that nitrate levels increased and ferredoxin-dependent glutamine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase activities decreased under low R/FR light, however, no other pathway enzymes were affected. Changes in the pathway appear to be PhyB-independent, as Arabidopsis phyB mutant did not change the nitrate levels compared to wild-type Arabidopsis. The research indicates the importance of mitigating early-season weed competition and offers insight into the early physiological mechanisms involved in nitrogen utilization under resource-independent competition.</p><p>This data was collected as part of William Kramer's MSc research work (see Related Publication).</p>","2016-11 to  2021-10","Department of Plant Agriculture.

Management is difficult due to the longevity of resting spores, the overwintering structure, in the soil. The efficacy of an experimental biofumigant was tested in both field and controlled environment studies. The field trial was conducted on high organic matter (muck) soil comparing 150 L/ha of biofumigant applied with a watering can to a control. In repeated controlled environment studies, 150 L/ha was applied to mineral and muck soils, in sealed plastic bags before transferring soil into pots. Soil samples were taken pre-and post-treatment application to determine the effect on resting spore number. All trials were seeded with clubroot susceptible canola and assessed for clubroot development six or seven weeks after seeding using a 0-3 scale to calculate disease severity index. In the field trial, there was no effect on clubroot severity. There was a decrease in resting spore concentrations, however it was not significant enough to decrease disease development. In the first repetition of the controlled environment study there was low severity and incidence in both soil types. The biofumigant caused a decrease in severity, however there was no interaction with soil type. In the repetition there was no clubroot development in mineral soil but high disease severity in muck soil. There was no effect of the biofumigant on disease severity. The experimental biofumigant may be more efficacious when there is lower disease pressure, however, more research is required.","2022-09-01 to  2022-09-30","Department of Plant Agriculture.

Consistent results were achieved in the controlled environment assays and cultivar, location on the spear, isolate, wounding, and lighting were each found to affect lesion formation. In the field, an interaction was identified between cultivar resistance and acute weather, especially heavy rainfall, before and during a critical infection period. In controlled environment studies there was an interaction between cultivar and location of inoculation on the spear, whether near the top or base. The bioassay was useful for assessing some mechanisms of resistance, but inoculating attached spears in the field, while accounting for weather, is recommended for determining realistic field results.","2019-05 to  2020-08","Department of Plant Agriculture.

James; Hailu, Getu; Nazli, Hina","Agricultural Sciences; Social Sciences","land endowment; rental markets; rural Pakistan","survey","Ownership and access to land remains a long-standing issue of concern in Pakistan. The unequal land distribution is well documented. Although agriculture employs half of the country’s workforce, an estimated 60% of rural households are landless.  In this setting rental markets play an important role in facilitating access to land. In this paper we empirically examine key factors that influence the amount of land rented in. Specifically, we explore the relationship between one’s endowment of land and the amount of land rented in. We perform our analysis using the Pakistan Rural Household Panel Survey round 3.5 by conducted by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) in 2014-2015. The survey covers a wide range of topics including household characteristics, crop production, land management, farm assets, land inheritance and tenure security. Agricultural production activities are recorded for the Rabi season (2013-2014) and the Kharif season 2014. Of the 1027 household observations taken from the Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces in Pakistan, the average household’s endowment of land is 3.4 acres. Our regression analysis indicates that households with larger endowments of land rent in less land. For an additional acre in land endowment, the amount rented in decreases by 0.32 acres. This number has economic significance given the high proportion of smallholdings and the prevalence of landlessness in Pakistan Hence, households with smaller initial endowments of farmland rely more heavily on the rental market to achieve scale in food production.  Additionally, we provide evidence that factors like household size and asset ownership influence rental patterns. On average, an additional household member would increase the amount rented in by 0.12 acres. Tractor ownership also has a positive effect on the amount of land rented in. However, our regression estimates suggest that transactions are present in the farmland market thus preventing renters from reaching their optimal farm size. These results are relevant to ongoing efforts to support and enhance agricultural productivity in the region.","2014-11 to  2015-01","Department of Food, Agricultural and Resource Economics.

In comparison to a baseline that quantitatively elicits anglers’ WTP for the use of eDNA toolkits, this study also estimates how additional information regarding genomic technologies influences WTP. Results indicate that the provision of additional information has no significant effect on respondents’ WTP. On average, Canadian recreational anglers are willing to pay premiums between 7%-23% of their reported annual fishing expenditure to fish on otherwise-identical watersheds adopting novel eDNA toolkits.

This study addressed the responses of insect herbivores to elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) across numerous insect orders and feeding guilds. The changes in 19 animal response variables to the main effect of elevated CO2 was examined.  The study also addressed underlying plant mechanisms by quantifying those plant growth and metabolite responses most relevant to insect herbivory and examined how such responses were altered by numerous biotic and abiotic factors. Examined were the main effects of elevated CO2 on: six plant growth and allocation responses, seven primary metabolite responses, eight secondary metabolite responses, and four physical defense responses. These response variable changes were examined under two-way and three-way interactions between CO2 and: soil nitrogen, ambient temperature, drought, light availability, photosynthetic pathway, reproductive system, plant growth rate, plant growth form, tissue type, and nitrogen fixation.","2009 to  2010","School of Environmental Sciences.

Despite the importance of studying early life stages, very few standard protocols for benthic invertebrates commonly used in ecotoxicological assessments measure developmental endpoints. The goal of the present study was to develop and optimize a robust standard protocol for studying embryonic endpoints in freshwater gastropods. The developed method was then used to characterize the sensitivity of numerous embryonic endpoints (viability, hatching, deformities, and biomass production), in conjunction with juvenile and adult mortality, for the snail Planorbella pilsbryi exposed to a suite of metals (Cu, Cd, & Ni). Biomass production was typically the most sensitive endpoint but was relatively variable while embryo hatching was slightly less sensitive but highly consistent for all three metals. However, no single embryonic endpoint was consistently the most sensitive which demonstrates the importance of assessing a broad range of endpoints, life stages, and organisms in ecotoxicological risk assessment. Interestingly, the embryonic life stage of P. pilsbryi was considerably less sensitive to Cu exposure compared with juvenile and adult mortality. However, for Cd exposure, embryonic endpoints were the most sensitive and for Ni exposure were similarly sensitive to juvenile and adult mortality. This study has valuable applications in conducting developmental toxicity research with organisms lacking standardized testing protocol as well as future applications in multi-generational and in silico toxicity research."," to  ","School of Environmental Sciences.

As a PW-SIT program has yet to be considered, this foundational research determined that a gamma radiation dose of 110 Gy applied to PW pupae was necessary to induce > 99% sterility in females, and > 97% sterility in males, though the longevity, spontaneous flight activity, sperm production, and mating competitiveness of the sterile adults were negatively impacted by the treatment. Based on this work, a PW-SIT program could effectively and sustainably manage total PW populations in field or greenhouse pepper crops, and further research is recommended to ensure its success.","2021-02 to  2021-10","School of Environmental Sciences.

A novel, 28-d toxicity test method was created to optimize the reproduction endpoints by initiating tests with sexually mature amphipods to eliminate the confounding effects of growth, using a sex ratio of 2.3 females per male to reduce reproductive variability, and conducting tests in water-only conditions to improve juvenile recovery. The novel method was evaluated by comparing the sensitivity and reliability of reproduction data to standard methods. Reproduction endpoints produced similar results between methods, but the data were less variable in novel tests.

Periphyton are a vital dietary component for grazing organisms in aquatic ecosystems but can also accumulate substantial levels of pesticides from the surrounding water. Consequently, grazing aquatic organisms are likely subjected to pesticide exposure through the consumption of pesticide contaminated periphyton. The objectives of this study were to determine if pesticides partition into periphyton in riverine environments across Southern Ontario, and if so, to determine the toxicity of pesticides in periphyton when fed to the grazing mayfly Neocloeon triangulifer. Ten sites across Southern Ontario were sampled between May-September 2021. Sites with low, medium, and high pesticide exposure based on historic water quality monitoring data were selected to incorporate a pesticide exposure gradient into the study design. Artificial substrate samplers were utilized to colonize periphyton in situ, which was then analyzed for the presence of ~500 pesticides. Results from this study demonstrate that periphyton is capable of accumulating pesticides in agricultural streams. A novel, 7-day toxicity test method was created to investigate the effects of pesticides partitioned into periphyton when fed to N. triangulifer. Periphyton collected from the field sites were fed to N. triangulifer and survival and biomass production were recorded. Survival and biomass production significantly decreased when fed periphyton colonized in streams with catchments dominated by agricultural land use (p<0.05). However, the relationship observed between pesticide concentration and survival or biomass production was not consistent. Using field colonized periphyton allowed us to assess dietary toxicity of environmentally relevant concentrations of pesticide mixtures, however nutrition and taxonomic composition of the periphyton may vary between sites. We recommend future research to simulate individual pesticide exposures to periphyton in the laboratory prior to performing these novel dietary toxicity assessments.","2021-05 to  2021-09","School of Environmental Sciences.
